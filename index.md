I am a recent mathematics Ph.D. and postdoc with specializations in harmonic analysis, analysis of differential equations, and nonlinear dispersive PDEs.
I have recently left academia and am making the transition to industry.
I am broadly interested in opportunities in (but not limited to) software development/engineering, data science, and modelling/simulation, with a preference for research positions.

I am currently on the job market and open to recruiters.
I prefer to be contacted through LinkedIn.
