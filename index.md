I am a mathematician with specializations in harmonic analysis, analysis of differential equations, and nonlinear dispersive PDEs.
I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from UCLA in 2021, under the direction of my advisors [Rowan Killip](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~killip/) and [Monica Vi»ôan](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~visan/).
I am currently a Senior Systems Analyst at [MIT Lincoln Laboratory](https://www.ll.mit.edu/).
If you'd like to connect, I prefer to be contacted through LinkedIn.
